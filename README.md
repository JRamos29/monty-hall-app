## Monty Hall App

This is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app that simulates the Monty Hall problem.

The [Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall.
The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975.
